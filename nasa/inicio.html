            <h3>Marcy-13 is a rocky planet orbiting around a red giant star constantly in the shadow of another gas giant planet, this planet does not receive any sunlight. It has 2 moons orbiting it
                Jaci-Alpha and Jaci-Beta are two moons of different sizes, with Jaci-Alpha being the largest, Marcy-13 has 82% of its surface made of frozen water and its average temperature
                of -6Â° celcius, it has an atmosphere similar to that of the earth, being 68% nitrogen, 18% helium and 14% oxygen, even though its density is almost the same as the earth, its gravity
                on the other hand, it is 79% larger than that of Earth, possibly having an abundance of copper in its resources, with the ore estimated to represent around 85% of the planet's resources, 
                while iron represents 10% of the total, and the remainder still remains undiscovered.
